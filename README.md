Code to implement simulations and data analyses from "A perturbation method for inference on regularized regression estimates"

The functions in this code can be used to obtain confidence intervals for regression coefficients from certain regularized regression methods. Please see the article for reference.

# Instructions

To replicate the simulations, run the files:
1-run-ResampleALASSO-simulations.R
2-run-CompressResample-simulations.R
3-run-Summary-simulations.R

for various values of `paramnum` to obtain different settings.

To replicate the data analysis, run the file:
ALASSO-HIVexample-May2012.R
